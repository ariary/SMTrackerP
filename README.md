# Simple Mail T(racker) Protocol 🎣 📨

Ensure your email has been read.

***Why?***
* Because many SMTP clients don't provide "acknowledgement of receipt" anymore
* In phishing simulation (with the prior agreements of course!), retrieve information about who read, with which computer at what time etc..
* For commercial mail, to see who has been attracted by your email, but it is definitely not cool!


*Current state is a very naive implementation, may be enhancements will be made espacially for the phishing use case (deal with multiple targets, directly send the email providing a mail list, etc..)*

## 🚀 Launch instructions

**1️ Launch `smtrackerp`**

```shell
cd $(mktemp -d) # preferably in temporary dir
smtrackerp -e [your_external_url] [target_mail]
```

**2️ Insert payload in your mail**

`smtrackerp` will generate a html file containing an invisible image. Insert it in your mail.

Send it!

**3️ Wait..**
